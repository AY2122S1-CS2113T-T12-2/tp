### Enhancements Implemented
I have implemented the following enhancements

1. Filtering of expenses by category, payer, description, which allows the user to search for expenses based on their
   specific requirements.
2. Payment optimization, where the number of transactions required to ensure that everyone is paid back is reduced.
### Contributions to the UG
I have contributed to these sections in the UG

1. `view` section, where I have contributed most of the initial content, before my team mates helped to refine it to
    make it clearer for the users.
2. `optimize` section, where I help write the explanations so that the user can have a clearer understanding of what the
   function does.
### Contributions to the DG
I have contributed to these sections in the DG

1. `Expense` section, where I wrote the majority of the explanation and did up 2 diagrams, one to show the interactions
    the `Expense` and other classes and interfaces. I also did up a comprehensive sequence diagram that illustrated clearly the flow of the initialization of an `Expense`.

### Contributions to team-based tasks
I contributed in these areas for team-based tasks

1. Code enhancements: I ensured that the code that people were requesting to merge in were neat and I recommended multiple ways for the code to be neatened such as removing magic numbers/strings.

### Review/Mentoring Contributions
I contributed in review/mentoring in these areas

1. I suggested ways for the code to be refactored so that our overall readability can be improved. This was largely done during our meetings.
2. I thoroughly tested other team's code and gave them valuable inputs to improve their interface.
