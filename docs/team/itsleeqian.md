Additionally, I was also in charge of finalizing the formatting and readability of the UG, standardizing various aspects of each section.

#### DG Contribution
I have contributed the following to the DG:

1. The whole of the Architecture section, including the Architectural diagram and architectural sequence diagram.
2. The UML diagram for Person

#### Team based tasks Contribution
1. I helped to review my members' pull requests into our team repository, ensuring that the incoming code has no conflicts with the existing code. I would also discuss with the relevant members for any further improvements on the incoming code, and clarify any misunderstandings that appear.
2. Throughout the project, I helped to spot and rectify various bugs and issues that popped up.

#### Review/mentoring contributions
Throughout the team project, I made sure that I was fully aware of all the different functions and enhancements added by my teammates.
By doing so, I was then able to review the code properly and guide my teammates on any possible improvements. 
Having complete understanding of the code also allowed me to help clarify any doubts and misunderstandings from my teammates regarding our project.
