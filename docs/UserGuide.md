# User Guide

## Introduction

PayMeBack is a CLI-based expense tracker for a group of friends travelling overseas together.

In such a group, it is easier for an individual to pay for expenses on behalf of the group rather than each
individual paying for their share for every activity. At the end of the day, it is quite troublesome to
manually calculate how much money each individual owes to another. PayMeBack is designed to make this process
easy and fuss-free.

## Quick Start
1. Ensure that you have Java 11 installed.
1. Down the latest version of `PayMeBack.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/releases).

## Features

### Saving your data

By default, the program attempts to save your data each time after you run a command. This includes
the `quit` command.

If the save attempt is unsuccessful, you will see this error message:

```
//error message not yet determined
```

and the program will attempt to save again the next time you run a command.

### Trips

#### Create New Trip

Creates a new trip in the program.

You must have at least one trip created (or loaded from the save file) to use any other function.

The input syntax to create a trip is:
```
create [location] [date] [local-currency] [exchange-rate] [persons-in-trip]
```

- `date` must follow the format of dd-MM-yyyy
- `persons-in-trip` should be separated with commas and without spaces between each name

For example,

```
create America 02-02-2021 USD 0.74 ben,jerry,tom
```

If your trip is successfully created, you'll see the following message:

```
Your trip to America on 02 Feb 2021 has been successfully added.
```

#### Open Trip

In order to add, edit or delete expenses within a trip, you must first open the trip containing
the expenses you wish to add/modify/delete.

To open a trip, enter

```
open [trip-number]
```

If successful, you'll see the following message:

```
You have opened the following trip:
America | 02 Feb 2021
```

#### Delete a trip

Deletes a trip from the program.

The input syntax to delete a trip is:
```
delete [trip-number]
```
- `[trip-number]` is the index of the trip you wish to delete, and can be found by using `whatcommand` command.

If your trip is successfully deleted, you'll see the following message:

```
Your trip to America on 02 Feb 2021 has been successfully removed.
```
