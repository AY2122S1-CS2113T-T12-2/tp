## Overview
PayMeBack helps travellers who are on a budget manage their finances when travelling with friends. 

## Summary of Contributions
The following section provides a summary of what I have contributed to the project.

### Code Contributed
I have contributed over 1800 lines of code, split among documentation, test and functional code. <br />
My code contributions can be found via this 
[link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=joshualeeky). 

### Enhancements implemented
I have contributed the following features to PayMeBack:
1. The Person class and ExpenseSplitter interface.
2. The `expense` command which allows users to enter an expense into a trip and allocate amounts to each person in the
expense. 
4. The `amount` command which gives a brief overview of the amount of money that is owed between the person called and 
the other people in the trip in both the currency spent and the currency that is to be repaid.
5. The printing of currency in a user-friendly manner.

### Contributions to the UG
For the user guide, I contributed mainly to the features that I implemented, which includes the section on the command 
`amount` as well as the whole section regarding the command `expense`. Apart from the mentioned parts, I also
contributed in the creation of the table of available currencies. The user guide can be found 
[here](https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-t12-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html).

### Contributions to the DG
For the developer guide, I contributed to the sequence as well as the class diagram of the `parser` class and the class' 
overall description. The developer guide can be found 
[here](https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-t12-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html).

### Contributions to team-based tasks
In terms of contributions to team-based tasks, I feel like I have contributed most significantly in the following areas:
1. I helped to review members' pull requests into the GitHub repository while ensuring that whatever is being merged
will not conflict with existing code.
2. I assisted in the refactoring of functions to help with the overall neatness of the project.
3. I openly reached out to help any teammate who may have any bugs in their code with whatever tips and advice
I could offer.


### Review/mentoring contributions
Throughout the project I ensured I was fully aware of the different functions and enhancements each member was adding 
into the project. This allowed me to understand the scope and capabilities of the program so that I would be able to
guide the team in areas of improvement if needed. This also allowed me to help with any misunderstandings a member may 
have with the overall structure of the program.

### Contributions beyond the project team
I took part in peer review exercises seriously to give sincere and meaningful feedback to other teams to help them 
improve their projects.
