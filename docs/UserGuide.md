# User Guide

## Introduction

PayMeBack is a CLI-based expense tracker for a group of friends travelling overseas together.

In such a group, it is easier for an individual to pay for expenses on behalf of the group rather than each
individual paying for their share for every activity. At the end of the day, it is quite troublesome to
manually calculate how much money each individual owes to another. PayMeBack is designed to make this process
easy and fuss-free.

## Quick Start
1. Ensure that you have Java 11 installed.
1. Down the latest version of `PayMeBack.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/releases).
