the other people in the trip in both the currency spent and the currency that is to be repaid.

### Contributions to team-based tasks
In terms of contributions to team-based tasks, I feel like I have contributed most significantly in the following areas:
1. I helped to review members' pull requests into the GitHub repository while ensuring that whatever is being merged
will not conflict with existing code.
2. I assisted in the refactoring of functions to help with the overall neatness of the project.


### Review/mentoring contributions
Throughout the project I ensured I was fully aware of the different functions and enhancements each member was adding 
into the project. This allowed me to understand the scope and capabilities of the program so that I would be able to
guide the team in areas of improvement if needed. This also allowed me to help with any misunderstandings a member may 
have with the overall structure of the program.

### Contributions beyond the project team
I took part in peer review exercises seriously to give sincere and meaningful feedback to other teams to help them 
improve their projects.
